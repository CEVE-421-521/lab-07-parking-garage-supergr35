# Uncertainty Analysis
## Generate SOWs

I use the same n_years of 20, and a discount_rate of 0.12. However I will take 10,000 samples of a normal distribution for the demand growth rate centered at 80 with a standard deviation of 40 cars/yr. This is a bit of a broad range of uncertainty, but I justify it by saying that we're in an an important era of technological innovation with electric vehicles, which may affect future car demand positively or negatively.

```{julia}
demand_growth_dist = Normal(80.0, 40.0)
demand_growth_samples = [rand(demand_growth_dist) for _ in 1:10_000]

# first I'll use 10 of these to make sure the algorithm works
# later updated to 2000, similar to paper
demand_growth_vals = first(demand_growth_samples, 2000)
sows = [ParkingGarageSOW(; demand_growth_rate=rate, n_years=20, discount_rate=0.12) for rate in demand_growth_vals];
```

## Calculate NPVs

Consider my sampled SOWs and the base case SOW.
```{julia}
n_levels = 2:12
policies = [StaticPolicy(i) for i in n_levels]

results = []

for policy in policies
    # take the mean of all SOWs for the current level (policy) and add it to the results
    result_allsow = [simulate(sow, policy) for sow in sows]
    push!(results, mean(result_allsow))
end

# base case SOW
sow = ParkingGarageSOW(; demand_growth_rate=80.0, n_years=20, discount_rate=0.12)
profits = [simulate(sow, policy) for policy in policies]
```

Plot the results on top of the original plot.

```{julia}
# base plot
plot(
    n_levels,
    profits;
    ylabel="NPV Profits [Million USD]",
    xlabel="Number of levels",
    legend=true,
    size=(800, 400),
    marker=:circle,
    xticks=n_levels,
    label="Traditional NPV",
)
# new plot
plot!(
    n_levels,
    results;
    ylabel="NPV Profits [Million USD]",
    xlabel="Number of levels",
    marker=:circle,
    xticks=n_levels,
    label="Recognizing Uncertainty"
)
hline!([0], label="0 NPV")
```

# Adapative Comparisons
Compare single SOW fixed policy to adaptive policy.
```{julia}
# generate adaptive policy SOW
```
